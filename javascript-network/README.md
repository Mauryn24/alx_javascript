Deals with:
HTTP Requests: JavaScript can send HTTP requests to servers to retrieve data or interact with APIs. This is commonly done using the XMLHttpRequest object or the newer fetch() API.

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): AJAX is a technique that allows JavaScript to make asynchronous requests to a server without requiring a page refresh. It's often used to update parts of a web page dynamically without reloading the entire page.

WebSockets: JavaScript can establish WebSocket connections, which provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. This enables real-time communication between the client and server.

API Consumption: JavaScript can consume various web APIs provided by third-party services or your own server. These APIs can return data in formats like JSON or XML, which JavaScript can then parse and use.

Cookies and Local Storage: JavaScript can manipulate cookies and use local storage to store data on the client-side, enabling the storage of user-specific information or application settings.

Authentication and Authorization: JavaScript often handles user authentication and authorization by sending login credentials to a server and managing tokens or session information.

Error Handling and Status Codes: JavaScript can process HTTP status codes and handle errors returned by the server, enabling graceful error handling and user feedback.

Data Manipulation: JavaScript can manipulate and format data received from the network, making it suitable for rendering on the web page.

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs): JavaScript can be used to create PWAs, which are web applications that can work offline or with a limited network connection. This involves caching resources and managing data synchronization.

Cross-Origin Requests: JavaScript has mechanisms like Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to deal with security restrictions when making requests to different domains.

WebRTC: JavaScript can be used to implement real-time communication, such as video chats, through the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) API.

Server-Sent Events (SSE): JavaScript can establish SSE connections to receive real-time updates from the server in a unidirectional manner.

In summary, JavaScript plays a crucial role in handling various network-related tasks in web development, including making HTTP requests, managing data, handling real-time communication, and more, to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
